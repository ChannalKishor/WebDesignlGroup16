    question: "How often should I exercise?",
    answer:
      "The frequency of exercise depends on various factors such as your fitness level, goals, and schedule. In general, the American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week. This can be divided into several sessions throughout the week, for example, 30 minutes of exercise, five times a week.",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "What time of day is best to work out?",
    answer:
      "Research suggests that the body's core temperature is at its highest in the late afternoon, which may make this an optimal time for high-intensity workouts. However, the most important factor in determining the best time of day to work out is consistency.",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "How long should my workouts be?",
    answer:
      "The American College of Sports Medicine recommends that adults aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week. This can be broken down into 30-minute workouts on most days of the week.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "Do I need to warm up before my workouts?",
    answer:
      "Yes, it's important to warm up before your workouts. A proper warm-up can help prepare your body for the physical demands of exercise by increasing your heart rate, blood flow, and muscle temperature. This can help reduce the risk of injury, improve performance, and enhance overall workout effectiveness.",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Should I do strength training, cardio or both?",
    answer:
      "Strength training involves using resistance exercises to build and tone muscles, improve bone density, and increase overall strength. This can include using free weights, resistance bands, machines, or your own body weight.",
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "Should I lift weights for strength training?",
    answer:
      "Yes, lifting weights is an effective way to engage in strength training. Strength training involves using resistance exercises to build and tone muscles, improve bone density, and increase overall strength. Lifting weights, using resistance bands, or using your own body weight can all be effective forms of strength training.",
